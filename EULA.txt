Ivan goes to the roof and sits on the chair next to andrew's. Both drinking beers bloxy colas.
A: "Wow."
A: "This isn't too bad of a view. Better than I was expecting."
A: "Being in the center of a city and all."
I: "Yeah. Really makes the place a bit more lively."
A: "...I'm sorry for saying that."
I: "It's fine."
A: "No it's not."
A: "I obviously hurt you."
A: "Then I ignored your feelings and didn't apologise."
I: "..."
A: "I don't know what you're going through, but-"
I: "I'm not going through anything." (he interrupts, possibly the tumor?)
I: "But thanks." (change of tone, fake happier)
A: "Sorry."
A: "I'm bad with words."
A: "Guess that's why you're here."
I: "Speaking of, progress?"
A: "Oh, yeah. Uh..."
A: "Everything's according to plan."
A: "The game, if everything goes right, should be out a bit after New Year's."
I: "If everything goes right."
A: "..."
I: "You know I'd be happy to do more."
A: "...Why?"
I: "Huh?"
A: "Why do you want to work on the game so much?"
I: "I want to help my friend." (clearly not)
I: "It's not about the game, it's about you." (yeah sure)
I: "Ever since I knew you, you've been working nonstop, and now that it's caught up to you..."
I: "You won't let me fix the problem."
I: "If anything, you're pushing yourself harder."
A: "That's just how I cope, I guess."
A: "It's comfortable in familiar palces, and for me, it's less of a place and more of a..."
A: "...An actions?"
A: "I've learned that this is just how I am."
A: "I'm not burned out from the game. I love the game. I've loved making it."
A: "I don't know why I feel this way."
I: "You were always like this?"
I: "Fixing your issues with games?"
A: "It's the first thing that worked. I used to..."
A: "..."
A: "I used to fight. In school."
I: "Really? You beat people up?"
A: "Haha. I wouldn't say that."
A: "Most of the people I fought were twice my size."
A: "I don't know why. Guess I just wanted it to, uh."
A: "...hurt..." (masochist much?)
A: "...more."
A: "Skipped class, too."
A: "Man, it was... it was awful. It sucked."
A: "But I had this side thing of making crappy little games on roblox"
A: "And once, when things were really bad, like I was..."
A: "Um."
A: "And this kid wrote me a message after playing one of my games."
A: "They talked about how much they liked it, stuff like that, and,"
A: "Something about it, y'know?"
A: "..."
A: "And I cried."
A: "Like, full blown sobbing. It was embarrassing, to be honest."
A: "And it made something in me click, I guess. Made me realize what i wanted to do with myself."
I: "Just like that?"
A: "Well, no. I still hated school and had bad grades, but over time, I started putting effort into things I previously couldn't care less about."
I: "Heartwarming."
A: "Right?"
A: "Sounds like a bad coming-of-age movie. Haha."
I: "..."
I: "I'm gonna go get another cola."
You do exactly that
I: "..."
A: "Something just hit me, while you were down there."
A: "With how much I whine about mine, I've never heard you talk about your parents."
A: "Is there a reason?"
I: "Nope. I just have normal parents."
I: "Why do you ask?"
A: "Just wanted to know more about my friend."
A: "I wanna hear a bit about you after, well, venting to you a bit back there."
I: "..."
I: "Have you ever seen a dead body, Andrew?"
A: "No..? Why?"
I: "There is something, kinda, that I've been thinking about."
I: "So, my dad was a firefighter, right?"
I: "Great guy. Respectable job. Always took care of me."
I: "He was everything a child could ask for."
I: "Except maybe a safer profession."
I: "I loved him for being my dad and not anything more."
I: "..."
I: "Well, a couple years ago,"
I: "He ran into this burning building to save a guy."
I: "The ceiling, or a support column, something like that, snapped at just the right moment."
I: "Crushed his spine instantly, they told me"
I: "He was paralyzed."
A: "I'm... so sorry. That sounds awful."
I: "Don't be."
I: "That's just the way it goes."
I: "Anywho, they somehow were able to scrape enough of him into a casket for the funeral."
I: "Closed, obviously. Haha."
A: "..."
I: "When I walked into the church, my first thought was, <Am I early?> despite being 20 so minutes late."
I: "There were maybe 8 or 9 people. Total."
I: "Now, I knew he kept to himself, but that's ridiculous, right?"
I: "The point is, when I got my turn at the casket to say goodbye,"
I: "They forgot to lock the thing, and I peeked inside."
I: "That's the image of my dad in my head, now."
I: "A charred corpse in an empty church."
I: "That's what you get for helping people, I suppose."
I: "..."
A: "..."
A: "I think I'm gonna head inside to unpack."
A: "You might not want to stay outside. They said there's a storm coming tonight."
